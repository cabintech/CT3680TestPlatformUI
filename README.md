# CT3680TestPlatformUI
This repo contains the code for the CT3680 Test Platform user interface components including servlets that run in a local Tomcat web container, and HTML, CSS, and Javascript that run in a local browser. It also (future) invokes APIs in the cloud-based Cabintech enterprise server to record test data and update inventory.
